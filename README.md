# timed-promise

This is a rather simple and straightforward of a (typescript) implementation of `Promise` that allows for a timeout to be given. Published to NPM for my own convenience.

Requires Node v14.+ (see [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61305578/what-typescript-configuration-produces-output-closest-to-node-js-14-capabilities/61305579#61305579) on why).
