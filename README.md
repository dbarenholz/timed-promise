# timed-promise

Shameless reimplementation of [this](https://github.com/liqd-js/timed-promise) in typescript.
Package is published to npm under my name [@dbarenholz/timed-promise](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@dbarenholz/timed-promise) for my own convenience. Feel free to use it in your projects, but don't blame me if it breaks your code!

My personal goals for this repository:

- [X] Learning how to create a proper typescript config for building modules.
- [X] Learning how to publish a module to NPM.
- [X] Getting familiar with typescript, and particular differences between it and vanilla JS.

Documentation is available in the docs folder, which should be hosted via github for your convenience.
